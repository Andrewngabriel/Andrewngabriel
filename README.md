programmer based in nyc ðŸ—½

Started freelancing around 2014 by building small websites using WordPress then quickly grew to build much bigger web projects using a wide array of technologies. I was one of Fiverr's top rated sellers for 3 consecutive years and got featured in a few of their marketing campaigns. Around 2018, I decided to leave Fiverr and go fully independent under my own brand/company called AndrewTechful.

I enjoy reading, traveling, trying new restaurants, and exploring new subjects in the software industry (particullarly security)

**Interests**
- Mobile development - cross-platform using Flutter or React Native. Currently exploring native as well
- Low-level / systems programming - mostly kernel & driver development
- Software security
  - Binary analysis
  - OS Internals
- Aviation
- Broadcasting (live streaming)

**ðŸ”¨ Projects**
- [EgyFM](https://egy.fm) - Mobile app for streaming Egyptian radio stations ad-free. Available on iOS & Android. Built with Flutter.
